Lathering Skin Bar (20% superfat)
Makes approximately 44 oz. of soap.

Note: Because this soap is highly superfatted it can create a very dense lather when rubbed directly on skin. For a light, bubbly effect I recommend lathering with a natural sponge like this one.

33 oz coconut oil, 76 degree* (where to buy coconut oil)
4.83 ounces lye (NaOH)** (where to buy lye)
12.54 oz water
.5 ‚Äì 1 ounce essential oils (optional)
Laundry Soap (1% superfat)
Makes approximately 44 oz. of soap.

33 oz coconut oil, 76 degree* (where to buy coconut oil)
5.9 ounces lye (NaOH)** (where to buy lye)
12 oz water
.5 ‚Äì 1 ounce lavender or other essential oils (optional) (where to buy lavender essential oil)
* For soap making purposes there are several types of coconut oil. The stuff I buy has a melting point of 76 degrees. This is the most commonly available kind and the preferred type for soap making. There is also a coconut oil that has a melting point of 92 degrees and another that is ‚Äúfractionated,‚Äù meaning that the long chain triglycerides have been removed, leaving only saturated fats. I have not tested this recipe with either the 92 degree or fractionated oils, but it works well with the 76 degree type.

** You can often find pure lye with no additional plumbing/drain additives in the drain cleaner section of a mom n‚Äô pop hardware store. Lye is a naturally occurring substance that can be made by burning hardwoods and boiling the ashes, but it‚Äôs much easier to just buy. If you don‚Äôt see it, ask a sales clerk for help. They may be keeping it behind the counter because it has multiple uses. Be prepared to explain that you want to make soap, not meth. üôÇ
